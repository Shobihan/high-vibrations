## Testing
- The project looks very well structured for phone screens and larger devices, and it works on different browsers. The header stands out, and the navigation bar on larger screens is easily readable and convenient for users to see what the website entails. 

### Validator Testing 
- CSS - no errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
- HTML - couple of errors have been found when passed through using the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)

### Unfixed Bugs 
A couple of unfixed bugs have been found in my HTML code. Those are repeated occurrences of ID tags. The "positives" id tag had been several tags for <ul> as it is easier when styling the list items than doing them individually. The second unfixed bug is ' no <p> element in scope but a </p> has been seen. I do have a <p>, but it's too far above to be seen.
