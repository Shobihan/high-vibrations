## Testing
- The project looks very well structured for phone screens and larger devices, and it works on different browsers. The header stands out, and the navigation bar on larger screens is easily readable and convenient for users to see what the website entails. 

### Validator Testing 
- CSS - no errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
- HTML - a couple of errors have been found when passed through using the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)

### Unfixed Bugs 
- A couple of unfixed bugs have been found in my HTML code. Those are repeated occurrences of ID tags. The "positives" id tag had been used as an attribute for my lists in the main body, as I want my lists to all have the same list style type, and so I can adjust the padding from the left so it's easier for the user to read between the lines. The second unfixed bug is that there is no opening p tag in scope, but a p end tag is seen; there are repeated occurrences of this, however, I do have an opening p tag, but it's too far above to be seen.
