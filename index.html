            <p>Meditation can have an impact on mental and physical wellbeing when left unchecked. A common symptom that has affected many people is anxiety, this is a normal part of life, Even though they're real and can also be very overwhelming, they can be eased through meditation. During these practices you will feel like you are stepping away from all the noise and bustle of anxious thoughts and into a space of calm and clarity. The benefits of meditation aren't a myth and they're science-backed. Meditation:
             
                <ul id="positives">
                  <li><strong>helps to activate the brain's 'relaxation response." </strong>This counters the stress (or 'fight-or-flight) response and helps bring the body back to equilibrium. Regular meditation helps train our brains to enter this state of relaxation  more easily, even in the face of stressors.</li>
                  <li><strong>can increase our levels of 'feel good' chemicals</strong>, like serotonin and endorphins, helping us feel better in ourselves both physically and mentally.</li>
                  <li><strong>helps us enhance our emotional resilience,</strong>which enables us to bounce back from stressful situations more easily</li>
                </ul>

                Most meditation will help ease anxiety, but as with all things, you'll come to discover what resonatees best with you over time and with practise. here are six of the best meditation techniques for anxiety that you can add to your mental health toolbox. 
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Mindful meditation</strong>
                    <br>
                    Mindulness meditation is about learning to focus on the present moment with an attitude of non-judgemental. It can be challenging in a world wherer we're constantly planning, worrying, and overthinking. This practice encourages us to observe our anxious thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them.It's like sitting by a river, watching the water (or, in this case, our thoughts) flow by. With regular practice, we begin to cultivate a more relaxed, non-reactive state of mind.</li>
                    <li>Loving-Kindness Meditation<br>The beauty of Loving-Kindness meditation is that you’re fostering a sense of compassion and love towards yourself and others (yes, even the people you find challenging). It's about understanding that everyone has struggles and fears. A Loving-Kindness meditation can help to develop empathy and kindness, which can, in turn, reduce anxiety and feelings of isolation.</li>
                    <li>Guided Meditation<br>If sitting quietly with your thoughts feels a bit daunting, guided meditations can be a great place to start. These typically involve a teacher or guide who leads you through a meditation practice. They often incorporate elements from the techniques above, making it a mix-and-match of meditation goodness.</li>
                    <li>Breath Awareness Meditation<br>This is about tuning into your breath - the inhales, the exhales, the gentle rise and fall of your chest. The rhythm of your breath acts like an anchor, helping to settle anxious thoughts. Try Breathe Like The Ocean with Jeff Warren</li>
                    <li>Body Scan Meditation<br>This technique asks us to mentally "scan" our bodies, focusing on different parts one at a time. It's a form of mindfulness that encourages us to tune into our physical presence and sensations, anchoring the mind to the here and now instead of letting it spiral into anxiety-inducing thoughts.</li>
                </ol>
                Remember, everyone's journey with meditation is unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. It's about finding what resonates with you, so experiment with these techniques until you find your fit.
