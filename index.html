            <hr>
            <p>Meditation can have an impact on mental and physical wellbeing when left unchecked. A common symptom that has affected many people is anxiety, this is a normal part of life, Even though they're real and can also be very overwhelming, they can be eased through meditation. During these practices you will feel like you are stepping away from all the noise and bustle of anxious thoughts and into a space of calm and clarity. The benefits of meditation aren't a myth and they're science-backed. Meditation:
             
                <ul id="positives">
                  <li><strong>helps to activate the brain's 'relaxation response." </strong>This counters the stress (or 'fight-or-flight) response and helps bring the body back to equilibrium. Regular meditation helps train our brains to enter this state of relaxation  more easily, even in the face of stressors.</li>
                  <li><strong>can increase our levels of 'feel good' chemicals</strong>, like serotonin and endorphins, helping us feel better in ourselves both physically and mentally.</li>
                  <li><strong>helps us enhance our emotional resilience,</strong>which enables us to bounce back from stressful situations more easily</li>
                </ul>

                Most meditation will help ease anxiety, but as with all things, you'll come to discover what resonatees best with you over time and with practise. here are six of the best meditation techniques for anxiety that you can add to your mental health toolbox. 
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Mindful meditation</strong>
                    <br>
                    Mindulness meditation is about learning to focus on the present moment with an attitude of non-judgemental. It can be challenging in a world wherer we're constantly planning, worrying, and overthinking. This practice encourages us to observe our anxious thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them.It's like sitting by a river, watching the water (or, in this case, our thoughts) flow by. With regular practice, we begin to cultivate a more relaxed, non-reactive state of mind.</li>
                    <li>Loving-Kindness Meditation<br>The beauty of Loving-Kindness meditation is that you’re fostering a sense of compassion and love towards yourself and others (yes, even the people you find challenging). It's about understanding that everyone has struggles and fears. A Loving-Kindness meditation can help to develop empathy and kindness, which can, in turn, reduce anxiety and feelings of isolation.</li>
                    <li>Guided Meditation<br>If sitting quietly with your thoughts feels a bit daunting, guided meditations can be a great place to start. These typically involve a teacher or guide who leads you through a meditation practice. They often incorporate elements from the techniques above, making it a mix-and-match of meditation goodness.</li>
                    <li>Breath Awareness Meditation<br>This is about tuning into your breath - the inhales, the exhales, the gentle rise and fall of your chest. The rhythm of your breath acts like an anchor, helping to settle anxious thoughts. Try Breathe Like The Ocean with Jeff Warren</li>
                    <li>Body Scan Meditation<br>This technique asks us to mentally "scan" our bodies, focusing on different parts one at a time. It's a form of mindfulness that encourages us to tune into our physical presence and sensations, anchoring the mind to the here and now instead of letting it spiral into anxiety-inducing thoughts.</li>
                </ol>
                Remember, everyone's journey with meditation is unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. It's about finding what resonates with you, so experiment with these techniques until you find your fit.

                <h3>How does mindfulness work?<i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i></h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Mindfulness works by taking your focus to the present moment and away from other thoughts.The way we think, and what we think about, can affect how we feel and act. For example, if you think or worry a lot about upsetting past or future events, you might often feel sad or anxious.It is understandable to want to stop thinking about difficult things. But trying to get rid of upsetting thoughts can often make us think about them even more.</p>

                <h3>Mindfulness exercises<i class="fa-solid fa-person-walking"></i></h3>
                <hr>
                <p>If you want to try mindfulness, you don't need any special equipment for the following exercises:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Mindful eating<br>This involves paying attention to the taste, sight and textures of what you eat. Try this when drinking a cup of tea or coffee for example. You could focus on the temperature, how the liquid feels on your tongue, how sweet it tastes or watch the steam that it gives off.</li>
                    <li>Mindful moving, walking or running.<br>While exercising, try focusing on the feeling of your body moving. If you go for a mindful walk, you might notice the breeze against your skin, the feeling of your feet or hands against different textures on the ground or nearby surfaces, and the different smells around you.</li>
                    <li>Mindful colouring and drawing<br>Rather than trying to draw something in particular, focus on the colours and the sensation of your pencil against the paper. You could use a mindfulness colouring book or download mindfulness colouring images.</li>
                    <li>Mindful meditation<br>This involves sitting quietly to focus on your breathing, thoughts, sensations in your body or things you can sense around you. Try to bring your attention back to the present if your mind starts to wander. Many people also find that yoga helps them to concentrate on their breathing and focus on the present moment.
